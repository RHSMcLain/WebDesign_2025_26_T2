        There are a couple of approaches to CSS that provide some important convenience features
        <dl>
           <dt>CSS Variables</dt> 
           <dd>CSS Variables allow you to store a value by name and use it later in your css with the 'var(...)' function. This allows you to change that value easily and have it apply wherever it needs to be</dd>
            <dt>LESS preprocessor</dt>
            <dd>LESS preprocessor (among others) have different sets of rules to streamline how you specify your styling. In addition to allowing for variables, they allow you to nest your rules together for more concise, contextualized code. When you want to view the results, you have to run the preprocessing compile work. That compiler reads the LESS (or other) code and converts it into standard css.</dd>
