        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>First Page</h2>
            <a href="./index.html" target="demoPage">
                <img class="screenshot" src="./screenshots/index_html.png">
            </a>
            <p>This was the first page we did. It had an internal stylesheet and explored the different kinds of headers that are possible.</p>
        
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>Nav Demo</h2>
            <a href="./navDemo.html" target="demoPage">
                <img class="screenshot" src="./screenshots/navDemo_html.png">
            </a>
            <p>Showed how to include a navigation element and stressed that we should be using tags that represent the content accurately. That helps bots and browsers navigate the content effectively. </p>
            <p>Also, We went on to show a float layout and the use of IDs, by including two nav bars. One went across the top as it tends to do automatically, and one floated to the left.</p>
        
        </article>
        <h1>Details</h1>
            <article>
            <h2>Article Example</h2>
            <a href="./details/articleExample.html" target="demoPage">
                <img class="screenshot" src="./screenshots/articleExample_html.png">
            </a>
            <p>This page showed the use of articles to group information together--like with magazine or newspaper articles. Each one is likely to have a heading of some kind, maybe an image, certainly some paragraphs. This is a great way to structure information so automatic readers can group information effectively.  </p>
            <p>Styling these is a great way to separate groups of information using margins or borders, and maybe even rounded corners and/or box shadows (which we haven't actually learned yet :))

            </p>
        
        </article>
        <h1>External Stylesheets and Classes</h1> 
        <article>
            <h2>Stylesheets, Classes, and IDs</h2>
            <a href="./externalStylesheetsAndClasses/index.html" target="demoPage">
                <img class="screenshot" src="./screenshots/externalStylesheets.png">
            </a>
            <p>Here we finally started putting our styling into an external stylesheet file (extension .css). This allows us to apply the same stylesheet to multiple html pages. </p>
            <p>We also experimented with styling elements based on classes or IDs. Importantly, you can have more than one element with the same class on a page. Any given ID should only appear once on any html page.
            </p>
            <p>Also, it is worth noting that the more specific the identifier, the more priority that styling will take.</p>
